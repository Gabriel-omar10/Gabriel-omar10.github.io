                    <h3>SHREK</h3>
                    Once upon a time there was a lovely 
                    princess. But she had an enchantment 
                    upon her of a fearful sort which could 
                    only be broken by love's first kiss. 
                    She was locked away in a castle guarded 
                    by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. 
                    Many brave knights had attempted to 
                    free her from this dreadful prison, 
                    but non prevailed. She waited in the 
                    dragon's keep in the highest room of 
                    the tallest tower for her true love 
                    and true love's first kiss. (laughs) 
                    Like that's ever gonna happen. What 
                    a load of - (toilet flush)
                    <br>
                    Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his 
                    day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go 
                    after the ogre.
                    <br>
                    There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard 
                sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures 
                to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line 
                are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto 
                who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three 
                little pigs
                <br>
                The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down 
                onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the 
                table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes 
                up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.
